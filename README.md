# Risk-Management-Project-for-Attain-Answers

## Welcome to Risk Management Project of Attain Answers GWU Practicum.

### Project Description:
* Business Analytics Practicum Course Project(DNSC 6217), Attain, LLC, Washington DC
* Time: Sep. 2018 – Dec. 2018
* Participants: Xuan Yang, Mengchen Xiao, Weihang Wen, Yinian Lyu, Weichao Zhu
* Instructor: Prof. Shivraj Kanungo
* Company Main Contacts: Tim Pavlick(tpavlick@attain.com), Alex Brown(abbrown@attain.com)

### Problem Context
* Attain seeks to gain a holistic understanding of how risk affects its business. To that end Attain is conducting pathfinder analytics research to determine if Attain’s business is experiencing avoidable risks. Furthermore, we are examining whether our business risks can be explained by a smaller number of factors which drive individual risks.  During the summer we will learn more about how our business risks relate to each other, to the type of engagements we take on, and to engagement factors (services conducted, staff, project manager, etc).

* Attain has a robust multifactorial dataset from years of public and private sector engagements. We’d like to explore whether or not we can create a predictive model to account for this risk pool.

### Study Goals
* Examine risks and all other factors associated with Attain’s public sector engagement history to determine which factors to include in the model.  Identify some risks cluster together and if those clusters are correlated with the engagement factors in the model.

### Analytic Techniques
* To fully understand the profile of individual & multi-risk factors we expect the team to import & condition the risk data, show descriptive relationships, employ similarity measures (Cosine, LDA, etc.) and clustering methodologies. Also determine if clusters are predictable by engagement factors (services conducted, staff, project manager, etc).

### Source of Data
* Attain will provide the risk data sorted by customer (anonymized) and predictive factor.  Attain’s risk officer is preparing the data for consumability.

### Outcome Desired
* A model that predicts, for a given set of consulting engagement factors, which risks an engagement will experience.  Additionally, for each predicted risk, suggest the appropriate risk mitigation strategy and surface recurring risks, so that the Attain enterprise may see them and take action across the business.

### Procedures:
* Used Attain Answers AI library for text mining analysis on Attain resumes, which allows Attain to search by specific skills needed, for a given job, and to find the correct person; 
* Examined Attain risk data to understand if it is possible to predict recurring risks from the independent variables provided, e.g., schedule, budget, etc.; 
* Used Market Basket Association analysis to train machine learning model in order to match customers’ demand with Attain’s service;
* Researched, preformed, completed social network analysis and human behaviors analysis projects using Webhose.io, and Meltego.
